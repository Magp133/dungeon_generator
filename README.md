I do not like git. I've had to remake this damn thing.

I have made this as a map generator for the table top game Dungeons and Dragons.
This generates a planar drawing of a graph map in bokeh. 
Rooms are generated from the nodes within the graph and assigned types: monster, trap, shrine, boss, vault, shop.
Traps are generated from within the trap room where the data is from the traps.json file.
Monsters are generated within the monster room where the data is from the bestiary.csv file. This was downloaded from this site: https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#aarakocra_mm
