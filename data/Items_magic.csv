"Axe of the Dwarvish Lords","DMG","221","artifact","weapon (battleaxe), martial weapon, melee weapon","requires attunement","1d8, slashing, - thrown (20/60 ft.), versatile (1d10)","4 lb.","","Seeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince came to believe that his people needed something to unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol.Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the Brutal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With them, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords.Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it. Magic Weapon. The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a belt of dwarvenkind, a dwarven thrower, and a sword of sharpness. Random Properties.

If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed. Curse. The axe bears a curse that affects any non-dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature's physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a greater restoration or remove curse spell. Destroying the Axe. The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed. Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon.

"Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle","TCE","121","artifact","wondrous item","requires attunement","","","","The creations of the immortal hag Baba Yaga defy the laws of mortal magic. Among the notorious implements that cement her legend on countless worlds are the artifacts that propel her through the planes: Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle. These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn. Random Properties. This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the ""Artifacts"" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:2 minor beneficial properties1 major beneficial property1 minor detrimental property Properties of the Mortar. The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding-if there's enough space-up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature. Properties of the Pestle. The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra 1d8 force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn. Perfect Tools. While holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.You can also use the artifact as alchemist's supplies, brewer's supplies, cook's utensils, an herbalism kit, and a poisoner's kit. You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools. Primal Parts. As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes 4d10 force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs-into separate piles. Traverse the Night. If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature.You don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later. Bones Know Their Home. When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute. Destroying the Mortar and Pestle. The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga or by Baba Yaga herself."

If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw.

The staff has the spirits of all previous Blackstaffs trapped within it. Its creator, Khelben Arunsun, is the dominant personality among them. Like Khelben, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. It prefers to counsel its owner without exerting outright control. The staff's primary goal is to protect Waterdeep and its Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful.In the event that the holder of the office of the Blackstaff no longer serves the staff's wishes, the staff ceases to function until it finds a worthy inheritor—someone whose loyalty to Waterdeep is beyond reproach. Spirit Trap. When the Blackstaff dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff along with the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs. (A Blackstaff whose spirit is trapped in the staff can't be raised from the dead.)Destroying the staff would release the spirits trapped inside it, but in that event, Khelben's spirit can lodge itself inside any one piece of the staff that remains. The piece containing Khelben's spirit has the staff's Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, Khelben's spirit can make the staff whole again whenever he wishes. When the staff is remade, the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs become trapped inside it again. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands.

"Book of Exalted Deeds","DMG","222","artifact","wondrous item","requires attunement by a creature of good alignment","","5 lb.","","The definitive treatise on all that is good in the multiverse, the fabled Book of Exalted Deeds figures prominently in many religions. Rather than being a scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's various authors filled the pages with their own vision of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil.The Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind.Benefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book. Random Properties. The Book of Exalted Deeds has the following random properties:2 minor beneficial properties2 major beneficial properties Increased Wisdom.

You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with good creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends and undead within the halo's bright light make attack rolls against you with disadvantage. Destroying the Book. It is rumored that the Book of Exalted Deeds can't be destroyed as long as good exists in the multiverse. However, drowning the book in the River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its pages and renders the book powerless for 1d100 years."

"Crook of Rao","TCE","123","artifact","wondrous item","requires attunement","","","","Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the Crook of Rao -potentially for the final time. Random Properties. The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the ""Artifacts"" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:2 minor beneficial properties1 major beneficial property1 minor detrimental property Spells. The crook has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: aura of life (2 charges), aura of purity (2 charges), banishment (1 charge), beacon of hope (1 charge), mass cure wounds (3 charges). The crook regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. Absolute Banishment. While you are attuned to the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent back to its home plane and can't return to the plane the Crook of Rao banished it from for 100 years. Failing Matrix. Whenever the Crook of Rao's Absolute Banishment property is used, or when its last charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Reversal table. Any creatures conjured as a result of this effect appear in random unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are not under your control. Iggwilv's Curse. When the Crook was last used against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent gate spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.Extraplanar Reversald100Effect1-25A portal to a random plane opens.

Destroying or Repairing the Crook. The Crook of Rao can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god's tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property."

"Deck of Illusions","DMG","161","uncommon","wondrous item","","","","","This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature, except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.Playing CardIllusionAce of heartsRed dragonKing of heartsKnight and four guardsQueen of heartsSuccubus/IncubusJack of heartsDruidTen of heartsCloud giantNine of heartsEttinEight of heartsBugbearTwo of heartsGoblinAce of diamondsBeholderKing of diamondsArchmage and mage apprenticeQueen of diamondsNight hagJack of diamondsAssassinTen of diamondsFire giantNine of diamondsOgre mageEight of diamondsGnollTwo of diamondsKoboldAce of spadesLichKing of spadesPriest and two acolytesQueen of spadesMedusaJack of spadesVeteranTen of spadesFrost giantNine of spadesTrollEight of spadesHobgoblinTwo of spadesGoblinAce of clubsIron golemKing of clubsBandit captain and three banditsQueen of clubsErinyesJack of clubsBerserkerTen of clubsHill giantNine of clubsOgreEight of clubsOrcTwo of clubsKoboldjokers (2)You (the deck's owner)"
"Deck of Many More Things","BMT","51","legendary","wondrous item","","","","","Over the centuries since the first Deck of Many Things was created, many have sought and failed to replicate it. But some have created new cards. These forty-four additional cards are known collectively as the Deck of Many More Things. (More information on creating new cards for this deck appears in chapter 2.)Like the Deck of Many Things, the Deck of Many More Things manifests differently on various worlds. While it can include fewer or different cards, it frequently appears with a Deck of Many Things as part of a combined deck of sixty-six illuminated cards. The combined deck is usually protected by a box or pouch. The forty-four cards of the Deck of Many More Things bear similar imagery to those in the Deck of Many Things and have potent magical effects, which are detailed later in this description. Notably, cards from the Deck of Many More Things are more likely to be beneficial, though about a third of them are still dangerous.Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Unless a card allows you to draw additional cards, any cards drawn exceeding this number have no effect.As soon as you draw a card, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. Unless a card states otherwise, if you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.Unless it is the Fool or the Jester card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.The DM can use the physical cards provided in The Deck of Many Things card set to build a combined Deck of Many Things and Deck of Many More Things, including whichever cards they desire. Alternatively, roll on the Deck of Many More Things table below to randomly determine what cards are drawn.Deck of Many More Thingsd100Card01Aberration02Balance*03Beast04Book05Bridge06Campfire07Cavern08Celestial09Comet*10Construct11Corpse12Crossroads13Donjon*14Door15Dragon16Elemental17Euryale*18Expert19Fates*20Fey21Fiend22Flames*23Fool*24Gem*25Giant26Humanoid27Jester*28Key*29Knight*30Lance31Mage32Map33Maze34Mine35Monstrosity36Moon*37Ooze38Path39Pit40Plant41Priest42Prisoner43Puzzle*44Ring45Rogue*46Ruin*47Sage*48Shield49Ship50Skull*51Staff52Stairway53Star*54Statue55Sun*56Talons*57Tavern58Temple59Throne*60Tomb61Tower62Tree63Undead64Void*65Warrior66Well67-00Roll again* Found in the Deck of Many Things as depicted in the Dungeon Master's Guide Aberration. You gain telepathy within a range of 90 feet. Beast. You immediately transform into a random Beast with a CR of 5 or lower. Your game statistics—including your ability scores, hit points, and possible actions—are replaced by the Beast's game statistics, and any nonmagical equipment you're wearing or carrying melds into your new form and can't be used. Any magic items you're carrying drop in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your new form.You remain transformed in this way for 2d12 days; nothing can alter your form while you're under the effects of this card, but the Wish spell can end the transformation early. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the same state you were in when you initially transformed. Book. You gain the ability to speak, read, and write 1d6 + 2 languages of your choice.

Spells and other magical effects that restore hit points have no effect on you until you are stabilized. If you fail three death saving throws, you die and can be resurrected only by the Wish spell. Crossroads. Roll a d20. If the roll is even, you age 1d10 years. If the roll is odd, you become younger by 1d10 years, to a minimum of 1 year.

The precise location in the Feywild to which the fey crossing leads is determined by the DM. Fiend. A powerful Fiend appears in a nearby unoccupied space and offers you a deal. The precise nature of this deal is up to the DM, but usually the Fiend offers some material reward in exchange for you and your allies completing a task for the Fiend. The Fiend is indifferent to you and can be bargained with; it keeps its side of any bargain it makes, though it might twist the wording of any agreement to suit its purposes. If attacked, or if negotiations fail and you refuse the Fiend's offer, it returns to its home plane. Giant. You immediately grow 2d10 inches in height, and your hit point maximum and current hit points both increase by 20. Humanoid.

If you named a magic item that has charges, you know how many charges it has remaining. Maze. You gain 1d3 levels of exhaustion. Mine.

Your walking speed increases by 10 feet. Pit. A pit opens beneath you. You plummet 3d6 × 10 feet, take damage from the fall, and have the prone condition. Plant. You gain the ability to cast Speak with Plants without using a spell slot; you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again.

Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22. Prisoner. Glowing chains made of magical force appear and wrap around you. You have the restrained condition until the chains are destroyed or you are freed. While you have this condition, you can't cast spells, and any magic items you're wearing or carrying have their properties suppressed. You draw no more cards. The chains are immune to damage and can't be dispelled using the Dispel Magic spell or similar magic. However, a Disintegrate spell destroys the chains instantly, freeing you. Another creature can also free you by succeeding on a DC 30 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. Ring. A rare or rarer magic ring appears on your finger. If you have the attunement slots available, you're automatically attuned to the ring when it appears. The DM chooses the ring. Shield.

If you lack proficiency with any armor, your base AC instead now equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor. Ship. You gain proficiency in three skills chosen by the DM. Staff. A rare or rarer magic rod, staff, or wand appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item. Stairway. You can choose to either decrease your number of declared draws by two or receive a rare or rarer wondrous item, which appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item. Statue.

At any point in time between drawing the card and when you die, you can use your action to call on this entity for divine intervention, and the entity is bound to answer. The parameters and nature of this intervention are chosen by the DM. If you die without having used this intervention, the deity fulfills its obligation by casting the Resurrection spell on you. Once the entity has answered your call for divine intervention or resurrected you, the entity is no longer bound to aid you. Tomb. At any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can cast the True Resurrection spell once without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). Tower. Draw two additional cards beyond your declared number of draws.

The magic of the card you keep takes effect immediately thereafter. Tree. Your skin immediately becomes rough, like tree bark. Your base AC now equals 15 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor, but you have vulnerability to fire damage. This transformation can be undone only by the Wish spell, divine intervention, or similar magic. Undead. Somewhere on the Material Plane, a revenant rises. This revenant blames you for its existence and relentlessly hunts you to exact its revenge. The revenant exists until either 1 year passes, the revenant kills you, or you use a Wish spell to banish it permanently to the afterlife. Warrior. Your Strength score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22. Well. You learn three cantrips of your choice from any spell list."
"Deck of Many Things","BMT","13","legendary","wondrous item","","","","","A Deck of Many Things typically appears not as individual cards, but as a collection of cards characters can draw from. But this doesn't have to be true; you can give each card a property as a standalone item, so characters who find only one card can still enjoy this famed item and use the card on adventures.This approach is particularly useful if you make a Deck of Many Things the object of a quest; as the characters explore, each card they find grants them a magical ability they can use in subsequent adventures to find the cards that remain. Eventually the heroes assemble the entire deck, which they can then use in the traditional manner, drawing transformative cards from it in a fitting climax to the campaign.This deck item comprises the following individual cards:Balance CardComet CardDonjon CardEuryale CardFates CardFlames CardFool CardGem CardJester CardKey CardKnight CardMoon CardPuzzle CardRogue CardRuin CardSage CardSkull CardStar CardSun CardTalons CardThrone CardVoid Card"
"Deck of Many Things","DMG","162","legendary","wondrous item","","","","","Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice. A Question of Enmity. Two of the cards in a deck of many things can earn a character the enmity of another being. With the Flames card, the enmity is overt. The character should experience the devil's malevolent efforts on multiple occasions. Seeking out the fiend shouldn't be a simple task, and the adventurer should clash with the devil's allies and followers a few times before being able to confront the devil itself.In the case of the Rogue card, the enmity is secret and should come from someone thought to be a friend or an ally. As Dungeon Master, you should wait for a dramatically appropriate moment to reveal this enmity, leaving the adventurer guessing who is likely to become a betrayer.Playing CardCardAce of diamondsVizier*King of diamondsSunQueen of diamondsMoonJack of diamondsStarTwo of diamondsComet*Ace of heartsThe Fates*King of heartsThroneQueen of heartsKeyJack of heartsKnightTwo of heartsGem*Ace of clubsTalons*King of clubsThe VoidQueen of clubsFlamesJack of clubsSkullTwo of clubsIdiot*Ace of spadesDonjon*King of spadesRuinQueen of spadesEuryaleJack of spadesRogueTwo of spadesBalance*Joker (with TM)Fool*Joker (without TM)Jester* Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards Vizier.

You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the DM determines randomly) appears in your hands. Moon. You are granted the ability to cast the wish spell 1d3 times. Star. Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24. Comet. If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect. The Fates. Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die. Throne. You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours. Key. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon. Knight. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you.

Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet. Talons. Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish. The Void. This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards. Flames. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies. Skull. You summon an avatar of death—a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life. Idiot. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws. Donjon. You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards. Ruin. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears. Euryale. The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a −2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse. Rogue. A nonplayer character of the DM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you. Balance. Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you. Fool. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level. Jester. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws."

"Demonomicon of Iggwilv","TCE","125","artifact","wondrous item","requires attunement","","","","An expansive treatise documenting the Abyss's infinite layers and inhabitants, the Demonomicon of Iggwilv is the most thorough and blasphemous tome of demonology in the multiverse. The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book's spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. And the book holds more than blasphemies. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material. Random Properties. The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the ""Artifacts"" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:2 minor beneficial properties1 minor detrimental property1 major detrimental property Spells. The book has 8 charges. It regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to cast Tasha's hideous laughter from it or to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 20) from it: magic circle (1 charge), magic jar (3 charges), planar ally (3 charges), planar binding (2 charges), plane shift (to layers of the Abyss only; 3 charges), summon fiend (3 charges). Abyssal Reference. You can reference the Demonomicon whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (Survival) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the check. Fiendish Scourging. Your magic causes pain to fiends. While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling. Ensnarement. While carrying the book, whenever you cast the magic circle spell naming only fiends, or the planar binding spell targeting a fiend, the spell is cast at 9th level, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the fiend has disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell. Containment. The first 10 pages of the Demonomicon are blank. As an action while holding the book, you can target a fiend that you can see that is trapped within a magic circle. The fiend must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with disadvantage or become trapped within one of the Demonomicon's empty blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature's widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can't be used again until the next dawn.When you finish a long rest, if you and the Demonomicon are on the same plane of existence, the trapped creature of the highest challenge rating within the book can attempt to possess you. You must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. The possessing creature can release you as an action, appearing in the closest unoccupied space. On a successful save, the fiend can't try to possess you again for 7 days.When the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 fiends occupying its pages, typically an assortment of demons. Destroying the Demonomicon. To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book's pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book's remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost artifact, Fraz-Urb'luu's Staff. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and quite out-of-date copy of the Tome of Zyx, the work that served as the foundation for the Demonomicon. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu instantly knows."

The Draakhorn is a signaling device, and it is so large that it requires two Medium creatures (or one Large or larger) to hold it while a third creature sounds it, making the earth resonate to its call. The horn has been blasted with fire into a dark ebony hue and is wrapped in bands of bronze with draconic runes that glow with purple eldritch fire.The low, moaning drone of the Draakhorn discomfits normal animals within a few miles, and it alerts all dragons within two thousand miles to rise and be wary, for great danger is at hand. Coded blasts were once used to signal specific messages. Knowledge of those codes has been lost to the ages.Those with knowledge of the Draakhorn's history know that it was first built to signal danger to chromatic dragons—a purpose the Cult of the Dragon has corrupted to call chromatic dragons to the Well of Dragons from across the North.Within 50 feet of any enclosed space where the horn is blown, the air begins to shimmer from the sound. Any character within 20 feet of the entry to the enclosed space must succeed on a DC 12 Strength check to continue pushing against the pressure of the sound. A failure indicates the character can advance no farther toward the entry.For any character entering the enclosed space, the sound fades to silence—because any creature that enters the enclosed space is temporarily deafened and must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Success indicates the deafness ends 2 minutes after the Draakhorn ceases to sound. Failure indicates the character remains deafened for 1 hour after the Draakhorn ceases to sound.While the horn is sounding, a creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw the first time on a turn the creature enters a 150-foot cone in front of the horn or starts its turn there.

"Eye and Hand of Vecna","DMG","224","artifact","wondrous item","requires attunement","","","","Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed voice. Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's will in the world.The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die. Random Properties.

Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5 percent chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet.

"Iggwilv's Cauldron","WBtW","209","artifact","wondrous item","requires attunement by a spellcaster","","80 lb.","","Iggwilv crafted this wondrous cauldron with the help of her adoptive mother, the archfey Baba Yaga. The cauldron has two forms. Only Iggwilv or Baba Yaga can change the cauldron from one form to another (by using an action to touch it), which either can do without being attuned to the item. In its first form, the cauldron is made of solid gold and embossed on the outside with images of bare-branched trees, falling leaves, and broomsticks. In its second form, the cauldron is made of iron and embossed on the outside with images of bats, toads, cats, lizards, and snakes—eight of each animal. In either form, the cauldron is roughly 3 feet in diameter and has a 2-foot-wide mouth, a round lid with a molded handle at the top, and eight clawed feet for stability. The cauldron weighs 80 pounds when empty, and it can hold up to 100 gallons of liquid. Attunement. Any Humanoid creature that attunes to the cauldron must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be aged to the point of decrepitude. In this state, the creature's speed is halved, the range of its vision and hearing is reduced to 30 feet, and it has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The creature will reach the end of its natural life span in 3d8 days. Only a wish spell or divine intervention can reverse this aging effect on the creature.Three hags can attune to the cauldron simultaneously, provided they have formed a coven. If the coven disbands, the attunement ends for all three hags. Random Properties. Regardless of the form it takes, the cauldron has the following random properties:1 minor beneficial property (determined by rolling on the Minor Beneficial Properties table in the Dungeon Master's Guide)1 minor detrimental property (determined by rolling on the Minor Detrimental Properties table in the Dungeon Master's Guide) Gold Cauldron. The gold cauldron has the following properties:If water is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it transforms into a hearty, hot stew that provides one nourishing meal for up to four people per gallon of water used. The stew remains hot while in the cauldron, then cools naturally after it is removed. The outside of the cauldron remains safe to touch despite the heat of the stew.If wine is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 10 minutes, it transforms into a magical elixir that fortifies up to four people per gallon of wine used. Any creature that imbibes the elixir gains 10 temporary hit points. Any of the elixir that isn't consumed within 1 hour vanishes. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.When the cauldron is filled with 90 gallons of water mixed with 10 gallons of wine, it can be used as the focus for a scrying spell. When this spell is cast using the cauldron as its focus, the target of the spell fails its saving throw automatically, and the spell works even if its caster and the target are on different planes of existence. When the spell ends, all the liquid in the cauldron vanishes.Dipping the bristles of an ordinary broom into the water-filled cauldron transforms the broom into a broom of flying for 3 days. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn. Iron Cauldron. The iron cauldron has the following properties:You can use an action to scream into the empty cauldron, which magically summons a swarm of bats that flies out of the cauldron and acts immediately after you in the initiative order. The swarm obeys your commands and disappears after 1 minute if it hasn't been destroyed by then. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.If at least 1 gallon of blood is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it turns into a cloud of harmless black smoke that erupts from the cauldron and dissipates quickly. At the same time, all Humanoid creatures within a certain radius of the cauldron fall unconscious for 1 hour, except those that are attuned to the cauldron or immune to being charmed. The radius of the effect is 100 feet per gallon of blood used. An unconscious creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.Tying a dead frog or toad to the end of an ordinary branch and dipping it in the water-filled cauldron transforms the branch into a wand of polymorph with 3 charges. This wand can't recharge and crumbles to ashes when its final charge is expended. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again for 8 days.If you spend 1 minute touching the cauldron with a unicorn's horn while reciting the poem called ""The Witch Queen's Cauldron"" (see the accompanying sidebar), all creatures within 1,000 feet of the cauldron except those that are attuned to it become frozen in time. A time-frozen creature is incapacitated, can't move or speak, doesn't age, and is unaware of its surroundings or the passage of time. Moreover, it can't be moved, harmed in any way, or affected by any other magic. All other conditions and effects on the creature are suppressed until it is no longer frozen in time. Destroying the cauldron, sending it to another plane of existence, or touching it with a unicorn's horn for 1 minute while reciting ""The Witch Queen's Cauldron"" ends the time-freezing effect on all creatures. The effect also ends on any creature that comes into contact with an antimagic field or is touched by a unicorn's horn. Destroying the Cauldron. The cauldron is a Medium object with AC 19, 80 hit points, and immunity to damage from any source other than a flame tongue or frost brand weapon. Reducing the cauldron to 0 hit points with such a weapon shatters the cauldron into eight pieces of roughly equal size, whereupon all ongoing effects created by the cauldron end as it loses its magic.The destruction of Iggwilv's Cauldron causes all hags in the multiverse to lose the Shared Spellcasting trait gained by being in a coven (see the ""Hag Covens"" sidebar in the Monster Manual). Reconstructing the Cauldron. If all eight pieces of the shattered cauldron are within 5 feet of one another, a wish spell can reassemble them, restoring the cauldron and all its properties. The cauldron's reconstruction also restores the Shared Spellcasting trait of hag covens throughout the multiverse.The Witch Queen's Cauldron[–]As explained in the description of Iggwilv's Cauldron, the poem titled ""The Witch Queen's Cauldron"" is an incantation that hints at the time-freezing property of the artifact:“Eight cats perch atop eight dead attendingEight lizards flee from eight rats scavengingEight toads climbing meet eight dead and fallingEight snakes sneak under eight bats screamingEight eyes open, always dreamingAll on the cauldron that is ever seeming”"

The sealed box becomes immune to all damage as well. Every infernal puzzle box is constructed with a unique means of opening it. The trick to solving the puzzle is always mundane, never magical. Once a creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open a particular infernal puzzle box, that creature can open the box as an action, allowing access to the box's contents.A creature that spends 1 hour holding an infernal puzzle box while trying to open it can make a DC 30 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

While you wear the helm, your voice is magically altered to sound genderless, and you are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts, to determine whether you are lying, to know your alignment, or to know your creature type. Creatures can communicate telepathically with you only if you allow it. Lord's Amulet. This amulet bears the crest of Waterdeep. It functions as an amulet of proof against detection and location. Lord's Robe. This elegant robe functions as a ring of free action, and it creates the illusion that you have a nondescript, androgynous humanoid build and stand 6 feet tall."

"Luba's Tarokka of Souls","TCE","129","artifact","wondrous item","requires attunement","","","","Not all lingering spirits are tragic souls, lost on their way to the hereafter. Some languish as prisoners, souls so wicked mortals dare not free them upon an unsuspecting afterlife.Created by a figure of Vistani legend, Luba's Tarokka of Souls shaped the destiny of countless heroes. The prophecies of this deck of cards also revealed great evils and guided its creator into the path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck's creator, Mother Luba, narrowly escaped doom, spared only by her keen insights. But even for her, not all wickedness could be escaped. In the most dire cases, Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings of pure evil amid the strands of fate, imprisoning them within her tarokka deck. There these foul spirits dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foul—as it inevitably will.Like all tarokka decks, the Tarokka of Souls is a lavishly illustrated collection of fifty-four cards, comprising the fourteen cards of the high deck and forty other cards divided into four suits: coins, glyphs, stars, and swords. Random Properties. The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the ""Artifacts"" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:2 minor detrimental properties2 minor beneficial properties Spells. While holding the deck, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: comprehend languages, detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, locate object, or scrying. Once you use the deck to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn. Enduring Vision. While holding the deck, you automatically succeed on Constitution saving throws made to maintain your concentration on divination spells. Twist of Fate. As an action, you can draw a card from the deck and twist the fortune of another creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Choose one of the following effects:Weal. The creature has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the next hour.Woe. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the next hour.The deck can be used in this way twice, and you regain all expended uses at the next dawn. Prisoners of Fate. Whenever you use the Twist of Fate property, there is a chance that one of the souls trapped in the deck escapes. Roll d100 and consult the Souls of the Tarokka table. If you roll one of the high cards, the soul associated with it escapes. You can find its statistics in the Monster Manual. If you roll a soul that has already escaped, roll again.Souls of the Tarokkad100CardSoul1ArtifactFlameskull2BeastWraith3BrokenBanshee4DarklordVampire5DonjonMummy6ExecutionerDeath knight7GhostGhost8HorsemanMummy lord9InnocentGhost10MarionetteMummy11MistsWraith12RavenVampire spawn13SeerVampire14TempterVampire spawn15-100——The released soul appears at a random location within 10d10 miles of you and terrorizes the living. Until the released soul is destroyed, it gains the benefit of a weal from the deck's Twist of Fate property, and both you and the original target of Twist of Fate suffer the effect of woe. Shuffling Fate. If you go 7 days without using the Twist of Fate property, your attunement to Luba's Tarokka of Souls ends, and you can't attune to it again until after another creature uses Twist of Fate on you. Destroying the Deck. Luba's Tarokka of Souls can be destroyed only if all fourteen souls within are released and destroyed. This reveals a fifteenth soul, a lich, that inhabits the Nether card, which appears only when the fourteen souls are defeated. If this ancient entity is destroyed, the Nether card vanishes and the deck becomes a normal tarokka deck, with no special properties, but it includes a new card of the DM's design. Mother Luba and the Vistani. The creator of the Tarokka of Souls, Mother Luba was one of the most influential leaders of the Vistani. For untold generations, the Vistani have wandered the Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like the vampire-haunted realm of Barovia. These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell's horrors. Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks and of disparate origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid the endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists.A halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani in the Shadowfell. She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness and resilience-ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures of the night. ""We may wander amid the shadows,"" Mother Luba said. ""But we must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers.""Some years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only the Tarokka of Souls. It is said that if you draw the Mists card from it, you can hear the whispers of her kind voice."

"Mighty Servant of Leuk-o","TCE","131","artifact","wondrous item","requires attunement","","","","Named for the warlord who infamously employed it, the Mighty Servant of Leuk-o is a fantastically powerful, 10-foot-tall machine that turns into an animate construct when piloted. Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it-and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.Tales of the servant's origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the Machine of Lum the Mad. The best details on the device's origins and operation can be found in the Mind of Metal, a tome of artificer's secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad's several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty Servant of Leuk-o. Dangerous Attunement. Two creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature tries to attune to it, nothing happens.The servant's controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.Attuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 percent chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact. Controlling the Servant. While any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. A knock spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster's next turn.A creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the servant have total cover from effects originating outside it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.While you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls. During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways:Open or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn)Move the servant up to its speed (no action required)As an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in its stat block or some other action.When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack against that creature.While there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object. Ghost in the Machine. Upon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's discretion, takes one action while uncrewed.If the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned to it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature goes on a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the artifact-preferably using the servant, if possible. Self-Destruct. By inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant's two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.If the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 (25d6) force damage, 87 (25d6) lightning damage, and 87 (25d6) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.This does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, 2d6 days later, its parts—left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso—drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant. Destroying the Servant. The servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators. Alternatively, if the servant strikes the Machine of Lum the Mad, both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times the size and three times the damage as the servant's self-destruct property."

"Moonblade","DMG","217","legendary","weapon (longsword), martial weapon, melee weapon","requires attunement by an elf or half-elf of neutral good alignment","1d8, slashing, - versatile (1d10)","3 lb.","","Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a moon blade. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.A moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.A moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods.A moonblade won't serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.A moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moon blade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.Moonblade Propertiesd100Property01-40Increase the bonus to attack and damage rolls by 1, to a maximum of +3.

Each creature that can see you and is within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until you take a short rest while attuned to the weapon.97-98The moonblade functions as a ring of spell storing.99You can use an action to call forth an elfshadow, provided that you don't already have one serving you.

It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep. Personality. Every moonblade seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose.The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute.If a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack."

"Mudslick Tower","PaBTSO","219","very rare","wondrous item","","","","","You can use an action to place this 1-inch-diameter granite sphere on the ground and speak its command word, which is ""petrification"" in Terran. The sphere rapidly grows into a stout tower that remains until you use an action to touch the tower and speak the command word again, whereupon the tower shrinks back to a 1-inch-diameter granite sphere. The tower must be empty to shrink in this way. The tower bristles with muddy knobs that constantly extrude and retract across its surface, as though the tower were breathing through a coating of thick mud.Each creature in the area where the tower appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the tower. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.Whenever it expands, the mudslick tower merges with any natural stone it touches, awkwardly tipping and wedging itself to touch as much natural stone as it can.The tower is 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening.Although it looks like stone, the tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents creatures from tipping it over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. While merged with natural stone, the mudslick tower has immunity to all damage. Only a wish spell can repair the tower (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points."

On your turn, the orb can use an action to produce one of the following effects, targeting one or more creatures it has cursed: Unconsciousness. The cursed creature falls unconscious for 1 hour. The creature is roused if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. Visions of Terror. The cursed creature sees terrifying visions, causing it to view all creatures that aren't also cursed as dangerous monsters for 10 minutes. The cursed creature must use its action each round to make one attack against the nearest non-cursed creature. If the cursed creature has multiple possible targets, it attacks one at random. This effect ends if the cursed creature is incapacitated.After either of these effects ends, the affected creature is no longer cursed. The curse can also be removed from a creature with a remove curse spell or similar magic. All cases of the curse end if Murgaxor's orb is destroyed. Magical Signature. As a side effect of the orb's curse, the spell detect magic reveals an aura of enchantment surrounding creatures bearing the curse. This aura is distinctive, but in a way detect magic offers no further details about. Destroying the Orb.

Over a period of 1 minute, you can study a creature killed by someone in your franchise within the last 24 hours, then grant the character who slew it a d10. Once within the next hour, that character can add the d10 to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. If it's not clear who administered the killing blow, you grant this benefit to a random creature involved in the fight. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.d6Reading1Using a tiny bellows to pump one last breath into a corpse.2Reading the entrails with special reading-the-entrails glasses.3Burning a small piece of the body and looking for shapes in the smoke.4A cautious, reasoned, professional guesstimate.5Careful measurements.

"Orb of Dragonkind","DMG","225","artifact","wondrous item","requires attunement","","3 lb.","","Ages past, on the world of Krynn, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.While you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis (Tiamat's name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides. Random Properties. An Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties:2 minor beneficial properties1 minor detrimental property1 major detrimental property Spells. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges), or scrying (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges. Call Dragons. While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour. Destroying an Orb. An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however."

It hates the traditional foes of dwarves—giants, goblins, and, most of all, orcs—and silently urges its possessor to meet such creatures in battle. Heavy. Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively. Two-Handed.

Standing two feet high, the orrery housing is a wondrous device imbued with magic of its own, but the power of its six clockwork components makes the artifact even more potent.The Orrery of the Wanderer was created by a renowned clockwork mage known only as Lottie. She crafted the relic as a means of tapping into the power of the planes, and to channel the divination and foretelling powers of the stars. But Lottie soon realized that her creation was far more powerful than she had intended. As it tapped into planar magic, the orrery began to manifest the darkness and malevolence inherent to some of the planes. Eventually, it would impress upon its owner a desire to open portals into the most cursed and dangerous worlds, including the Far Realm.To prevent the orrery from ever being so used, Lottie scattered the components that powered it, secreting them across the world. But the orrery's instinct for survival is strong, and its components have a way of inexorably coming together over decades or centuries, found by treasure hunters, stolen by monsters, found and stolen again—and moving closer to each other all the time.Random Properties.

"Ring of Winter","ToA","207","artifact","ring","requires attunement","","1 lb.","","Artus Cimber has kept this item in his possession for over a century. The Ring of Winter is a golden band that resizes to fit snugly on the finger of its wearer. A thin layer of frost coats the outside of the ring, which normal heat can't melt. The ring feels ice cold to the touch and initially numbs the hand that wears it, but this cold ceases to be felt by one who is attuned to this ring.The Ring of Winter is sentient and tries to take control of any creature that wears it (see ""Sentient Magic Items"" chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). If it succeeds, the ring compels its wearer to cause undue harm to everyone and everything around it, in a cold-hearted attempt to incur the wrath of enemies and bring the wearer's doom. Sentience. The Ring of Winter is a sentient chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 17. The ring communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it, and it has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The ring craves destruction, and it likes inflicting indiscriminate harm on others. Nondetection. The Ring of Winter defies attempts to magically locate it. Neither the ring nor its wearer can be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors. Frozen Time. As long as you wear the ring, you don't age naturally. This effect is similar to suspended animation, in that your age doesn't catch up to you once the ring is removed. The ring doesn't protect its wearer from magical or supernatural aging effects, such as the Horrifying Visage of a ghost. Cold Immunity. While attuned to and wearing the ring, you have immunity to cold damage and don't suffer any ill effects from extreme cold (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon's Master Guide). Magic. The Ring of Winter has 12 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can expend the necessary number of charges to activate one of the following properties:You can expend 1 charge as an action and use the ring to lower the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 300 feet of you. The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of -30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless you use the ring to end it as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.You can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save DC 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: Bigby's hand (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), cone of cold (2 charges), flesh to ice (3 charges; as flesh to stone except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), ice storm (2 charges), Otiluke's freezing sphere (3 charges), sleet storm (1 charge), spike growth (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or wall of ice (2 charges).You can expend the necessary number of charges as an action and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can't have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (your choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The ice creature obeys only its creator's commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute as it melts. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary. Other Properties. The Ring of Winter is rumored to possess other properties that can be activated only by an evil being whose will the ring can't break. Frost giants have long believed that the ring can be used to freeze entire worlds, while a djinni in the service of a Calishite pasha once claimed that the ring could be used to summon and control white dragons, as well as the mighty ice primordial named Cryonax. Destroying the Ring. The ring is nigh indestructible, resisting even the most intense magical heat. If it is placed on the finger of the powerful archfey known as the Summer Queen, the ring melts away and is destroyed forever."

The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can't store, the rod has no effect on that spell.When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know.

"Shield of the Hidden Lord","BGDIA","225","legendary","armor (shield)","requires attunement","AC +2","6 lb.","","The Shield of the Hidden Lord is of celestial origin and serves as a prison for the pit fiend Gargauth, whose mortal followers revere it as a god.

On a successful save, the creature is immune to this power of the shield for the next 24 hours. Once the shield uses this power, it can't use it again until the next dawn. Gargauth's Personality. Gargauth desperately seeks freedom but can't escape on its own. The pit fiend won't reveal its true nature, referring to itself only as the Hidden Lord. It drops hints and subtle suggestions that it is an angel trapped in an unholy prison. If released from the shield, the pit fiend honors the terms of whatever bargain it struck to facilitate its escape.While trapped in the shield, Gargauth carefully steers the shield's current owner toward committing acts of cruelty and domination, hoping to condemn the individual's soul to the Nine Hells. Conflict occurs if the shield's owner does anything that would make it more difficult for Gargauth to escape its prison, such as leaving the shield in a place where others are unlikely to find it.Gargauth doesn't know how to escape from the shield. The pit fiend believes (incorrectly) that it can break free of the shield if it's brought to the Nine Hells, for it's convinced that the shield's powers are weaker there. Freeing Gargauth. Casting dispel evil and good on the shield has a 1 percent chance of freeing the pit fiend, or automatically succeeds if the spell is cast by a solar, a planetar, or an archdevil. A god can release the pit fiend by touching the shield and speaking Gargauth's name. When released, Gargauth appears in a random, unoccupied space as close to the shield as possible."

"Soul Coin","BGDIA","225","uncommon","wondrous item","","","⅓ lb.","","Soul coins are about 5 inches across and about an inch thick, minted from infernal iron. Each coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each soul coin has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag's curse. Carrying Soul Coins. To hold a soul coin is to feel the soul bound within it—overcome with rage or fraught with despair.An evil creature can carry as many soul coins as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A non-evil creature can carry a number of soul coins equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty. A non-evil creature carrying a number of soul coins greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Using a Soul Coin. A soul coin has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a soul coin and use it to do one of the following:Drain Life. You siphon away some of the soul's essence and gain 1d10 temporary hit points.Query. You telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response, which you can understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic. Freeing a Soul. Casting a spell that removes a curse on a soul coin frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM's choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from soul coins typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils.A soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A soul coin has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a hellfire weapon or an infernal war machine's furnace (see ""Soul Fuel"").Freeing a soul from a soul coin is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature. Hellish Currency. Soul coins are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered.Soul coins are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes."

It can also propel and maneuver a ship on water or underwater, provided the ship is built for such travel. The ship in question must weigh 1 ton or more.The sensation of being attuned to a spelljamming helm is akin to the pins-and-needles effect one experiences after one's arm or leg falls asleep, but not as painful.While attuned to a spelljamming helm and sitting in it, you gain the following abilities for as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell):You can use the spelljamming helm to move the ship through space, air, or water up to the ship's speed. If the ship is in space and no other objects weighing 1 ton or more are within 1 mile of it, you can use the spelljamming helm to move the vessel fast enough to travel 100 million miles in 24 hours.You can steer the vessel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the way that a rudder or oars can be used to maneuver a seafaring ship.At any time, you can see and hear what's happening on and around the vessel as though you were standing in a location of your choice aboard it. Transfer Attunement. You can use an action to touch a willing spellcaster. That creature attunes to the spelljamming helm immediately, and your attunement to it ends.Cost of a Spelljamming Helm[–]A spelljamming helm propels and steers a ship much as sails, oars, and rudders work on a seafaring vessel, and a spelljamming helm is easy to create if one has the proper spell. Create spelljamming helm has a material component cost of 5,000 gp, so that's the least one can pay to acquire a spelljamming helm.Wildspace merchants, including dohwars and mercanes (both described in Boo's Astral Menagerie), typically sell a spelljamming helm for substantially more than it cost to make. How much more depends on the market, but 7,500 gp would be a reasonable demand. A desperate buyer in a seller's market might pay 10,000 gp or more."
"Spellshard","ERLW","279","common","wondrous item","","","","","This polished Eberron dragonshard fits in the hand and stores information similar to a book. The shard can hold the equivalent of one book that's no more than 320 pages long. A shard can be created blank or already filled with information. When the shard is created, the creator can set a passphrase that must be spoken to access the information stored within.While holding the shard, you can use an action to open your mind to the shard, seeing its content in your mind. On subsequent rounds, reading the text or scribing new text on blank ""pages"" in the shard requires concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) and takes the same amount of time it takes you to read and write normally. Thinking of a particular phrase or topic draws you to the first section in the shard that addresses it.A wizard can use a spellshard as a spellbook, with the usual cost in gold and time to ""scribe"" a spell into the shard."

While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (using your spell save DC) or be cursed. While cursed in this way, the target can't regain hit points and has vulnerability to necrotic damage. A greater restoration, remove curse, or similar spell ends the curse on the target. The Forgotten One. The bodiless life force of a dead archmage empowers the staff and is imprisoned within it. The rune carved into the staff's skull protects Acererak from this spirit's vengeance. Each time a creature other than Acererak expends any of the staff's charges, there is a 50 percent chance that the life force tries to possess the staff wielder. The wielder must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be possessed, becoming an NPC under the DM's control. If the intruding life force is targeted by magic such as a dispel evil and good spell, it becomes trapped in the staff once more. Once it takes control of another creature, the insane spirit of the dead archmage attempts to destroy the staff. Destroying the Staff. A creature in possession of the staff can use an action to break it over one knee or a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 132 (24d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the staff is destroyed, the life force of the Forgotten One is released to the afterlife. Where it goes is anyone's guess. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands.

While Khazan was busying himself destroying the blade, his apprentice stole the hilt and fled. Khazan later located his apprentice's mutilated corpse in the Svalich Woods, but the hilt was nowhere to be found. To avoid the vampire's wrath, Khazan told Strahd that the entire weapon had been destroyed.The hilt, which is sentient, knows that it can never be reunited with its original crystal blade. It has, however, gained the properties of a sun blade:You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.

The Sunsword's special purpose is to destroy Strahd, not so much because it wants to free the land of Barovia from evil but because it wants revenge for the loss of its crystal blade. The weapon secretly fears its own destruction. Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

"Sword of Kas","DMG","226","artifact","weapon (longsword), martial weapon, melee weapon","requires attunement","1d8, slashing, - versatile (1d10)","3 lb.","","When Vecna grew in power, he appointed an evil and ruthless lieutenant, Kas the Bloody Handed, to act as his bodyguard and right hand. This despicable villain served as advisor, warlord, and assassin. His successes earned him Vecna's admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it.For a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich but as Kas's power grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich's empire in Vecna's stead. Legend says Vecna's destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby.The Sword of Kas is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead.If the sword isn't bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder takes 3d6 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the dominate monster spell, and the sword demands that it be bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met.

It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. Personality. The sword's purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the lich's works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.The Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the Eye and Hand of Vecna. The sword's obsession with those artifacts eventually becomes a fixation for its wielder. Destroying the Sword. A creature attuned to both the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna can use the wish property of those combined artifacts to unmake the Sword of Kas. The creature must cast the wish spell and make a Charisma check contested by the Charisma check of the sword. The sword must be within 30 feet of the creature, or the spell fails. If the sword wins the contest, nothing happens, and the wish spell is wasted. If the sword loses the contest, it is destroyed. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands.

Orcus allows the wand to slip from his grasp from time to time. When it does, it magically appears wherever its master senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal.Made from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped with a magically enlarged skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. Plants wither, drinks spoil, flesh rots, and vermin thrive in the wand's presence.Any creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the wand must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 necrotic damage.

It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.The wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal and Common. Personality. The wand's purpose is to help satisfy Orcus's desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cold, cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor. In order to further its master's goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus. Destroying the Wand. Destroying the Wand of Orcus requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life—no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.Bathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly reforms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss."
