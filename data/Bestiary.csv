The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space; appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies. Additional Lair Actions[–] At your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) white dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:Blinding Sleet. Driving sleet falls in a 40-foot-high, 20-foot-radius cylinder centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until initiative count 20 on the next round.Whirling Wind. A strong wind blows in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for rules on strong wind). The dragon's flying is not affected by this wind, which lasts until the next time the dragon uses a lair action or until the dragon dies.","The region containing a legendary white dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions when the dragon is at rest.Icy walls block off areas in the dragon's lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days. Additional Regional Effects[–] Any of these effects might appear in the area around a white dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the Monster Manual:Biting Chill. Extreme cold envelops the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for rules on extreme cold). If the climate in the area already features extreme cold, the cold is numbing, giving creatures in the area without immunity or resistance to cold damage disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks.Mirror Ice. The icy surfaces in the dragon's lair reflect light like mirrors, giving creatures in the lair other than the dragon disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage, any creature other than the dragon has a 50 percent chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.",Arctic

Grandmothers usually have three to five lair actions, aunties usually only one (if they have any at all). Unless otherwise noted, any lair action that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag's most powerful ability.On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hag can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects, but can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the hag can pass through solid walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if the surfaces weren't there.The hag targets any number of doors and windows that she can see, causing each one to either open or close as she wishes.

The inky areas are heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a steady, strong underwater current disperses the ink on initiative count 10. The hag ignores the obscuring effect of the ink.The hag chooses one humanoid within the lair and instantly creates a simulacrum of that creature (as if created with the simulacrum spell). This hideous simulacrum is formed out of seaweed, slime, half-eaten fish, and other garbage, but still generally resembles the creature it is imitating. This simulacrum obeys the hag's commands and is destroyed on initiative count 20 on the next round.","Each hag's lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the home of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven has more effects than the lair of a single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders.

These effects either end immediately if the hag dies or abandons the lair, or take up to 2d10 days to fade away.The region within 1 mile of a grandmother hag's lair is warped by the creature's fell magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:Birds, rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other creatures appropriate to the hag) are found in great profusion.Beasts that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed by the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls magically appear in trees.A powerful sea hag creates one or more of the following additional regional effects within 1 mile of her lair:Most surfaces are covered by a thin film of slime, which is slick and sticks to anything that touches it.Currents and tides are exceptionally strong and treacherous. Any ability check made to safely navigate or control a vessel moving through these waters has disadvantage.Shores are littered with dead, rotting fish.
